    "Substitutional doping of Mg and Zn in AlN introduces acceptor levels, leading to p-type conductivity by generating holes. In contrast, interstitial doping of Mg and Zn may introduce donor levels, potentially resulting in n-type conductivity by adding free electrons. Given the relative atomic masses of Mg (~24 amu) and Zn (~65 amu) compared to Al and N in AlN (~27 amu and ~14 amu, respectively), interstitial doping of Mg or Zn is likely to significantly distort the wurtzite structure of AlN. To accommodate these dopants and minimize structural distortion, we introduce a supercell ($n_1 \\times n_2 \\times n_3$) with a subset of doped cells."
